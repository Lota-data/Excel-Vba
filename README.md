# Excel-Vba


# Simple VBA SCRIPT
Sample2_VBA_script.bas file is a simple illustration of how I used VBA scripts and Macros recording to sieve the necessary information from the "Orders" sheet in the "Sample-Superstore" file.

Sample2-Superstore.xlsm is the final product of the VBA automation.


# Dictionary and class 
lota_dict_class.bas file:
So I made use of the dictionary library and a simple class(Superstoreclass) to automate the evaluation of the total sales and profit for each category. Then I put them on a new sheet. 
DICT superstore.xlsm shows the final product of this VBA automation.
